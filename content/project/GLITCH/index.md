GLITCH: Grammar Learning Techniques for L2

The **GLITCH** research project focuses on the role of memory in grammar learning in a second language. 
GLITCH stands for Grammar LearnIng TeCHniques for a second language. 
It is funded by a young researcher grant from the French National Research Agency (ANR) awarded to me for 2024-2028.
