title: "Exploring the Foreign Language Effect: A Study on Emotional Responses to Taboo Words"
event: AFLiCo 9
event_url: https://aflico9.sciencesconf.org

location: Lyon France

summary: "We will present the results of a study the autonomous reaction to swear words in L1 French and L2 English, as measured by electrodermal activity."
abstract: "The "foreign language effect" (FLE) is a psycholinguistic phenomenon observed in bilingual individuals, acting as an emotional &quot;filter&quot; that differentiates their native language (L1) from a
subsequently acquired foreign language (Pavelenko, 2005, 2008; Shanahan, 2008). This
disparity influences the emotional depth of language use, with L1 being more intuitive,
emotionally loaded, and context dependent (Grosjean & Li, 2013; Pavlenko, 2005).
In this study, we used electrodermal activity (EDA) to measure physiological reactions to taboo and neutral words in L1 French and L2 English.
Results show a language effect, with stronger reactions to taboo words in L1, consistent with a higher emotional depth of L1."
