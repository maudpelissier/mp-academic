title: "To voice or not to voice: cross-linguistic effects on phonological representations"
event: Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing (AMLAP) 2024
event_url: https://amlap2024.ed.ac.uk/

location: Edinburgh, United Kingdom

summary: "We will present the results of a study on asymmetries in second-language phonological representations, focused on the perception of two contrasts by Norwegian learners of English, one similar in the two languages (/t-d/) and one L2-specific (/s-z/)."
abstract: "We studied the perception of two contrasts by Norwegian learners of English, one similar in the two languages (/t-d/) and one L2-specific (/s-z/). 
Participants completed an ABX categorisation task, a lexical decision task (LDT) and an MMN task. Results reveal an asymmetry at the behavioural level between the two phonemes of the /s-z/ contrast: performance was worst when having to reject /z/ nonwords, i.e., nonwords created by replacing /z/ with /s/ (e.g., /ˈpɔɪsn/ for ‘poison’).
MMN analyses show an asymmetry between /t/ and /d/, with an MMN for deviant /t/ only, in line with previous studies with Danish speakers but not with English speakers. 
No asymmetry was found for the /s-z/ contrast."
