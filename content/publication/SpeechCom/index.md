abstract: Our perception of someone's accent influences our expectations about what they might say or do. In this experiment, EEG data were recorded while participants listened to clich√© sentences matching or not the stereotypes associated with the speaker's accent (upper-class Parisian accent or banlieue accent, a negatively connoted accent associated with youth from suburban areas; e.g. 'I always listen to rap in my car' said with a banlieue accent (congruent) or an upper-class accent (incongruent)). Mismatches between social accent and stereotypical content triggered an event-related potential (ERP) known as the N400, albeit more anterior than the one observed for semantic violations, as well as a P3. These results are in line with other studies conducted in particular with gender stereotypes suggesting that stereotypes are stored in semantic categorical knowledge and that mismatches trigger integration difficulties and checking and updating mechanisms, and extend them to socially marked accents.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, we examine what happens in the electrical activity of the brain when what the speaker says does not match their accent. Results show that these mismatches trigger an N400, a component usually associated with semantic violations, as well as a P3, a component related to the updating of expectations.
