abstract: >-
  This work examines the effect of learning conditions on the evolution of the neurocognitive mechanisms used by French speakers to process a second language (English). We used behavioural (acceptability judgments) and electrophysiological (event-related potentials) measures. Two types of training were compared, designed to reflect two learning situations : through exposure (implicit learning) or instruction (explicit learning).
  Two experiments were conducted. In the first one (E1), we studied how our trainings affected the processing of morphosyntactic violations working in a similar or conflictual way in the L2 and L1 of our participants. In the second experiment (E2), we tried to reduce the bias towards explicit learning entailed by the presence of violations, by studying how learners process temporary syntactic anomalies triggered by prosody-syntax mismatches.
  Results show a beneficial effect for both types of training. Explicit learning proved to be slightly more effective in improving the processing of a conflictual structure. In E2 it reduced the impact of individual abilities. E1 confirmed that the level of attention to grammaticality affects the nature and amplitude of ERP components. In E2, implicit training was linked to a faster and more automatic processing of incongruities.
  This research confirms that learning conditions can affect L2 processing even in a short time and for intermediate learners, but underlines the importance of reducing the biases towards explicit processing that are inherent to the EEG violation paradigm.
