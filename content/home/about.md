I am a Maître de Conférences (~Permanent lecturer) in psycholinguistics and second language acquisition at Université de Paris. My studies in English linguistics and cognitive science have led me to specialise in the cognitive aspects of the acquisition of English as a foreign language. 

At Université de Paris, I teach psycholinguistics and didactics.
